PROBLEM 7.6

Buf: Yes, in symtab.
	 Symbol Type - Extern

	   Section - .bss

swap: Yes, in symtab
	  Symbol Type - global
	  Module - swap.o
	  Section - .text

	  Symbol Type - local

PROBLEM 7.9

Since C doesn't initialize variables to any set value, the uninitialized 
variable main is set to whatever was at the point in memory that C
allocated for the variable to be. The stack frame doesn't contain 
newly allocated memory, so the contents of the memory at runtime 
will appear as the initial values of main, because main was never
initialized to any other value. 

PROBLEM 7.12

To do this problem we followed the steps outlined in the procedure Figure 7.10.
For a PC-relative reference, since the r.type is R_X86_64_PC32, we go to the 
if statement on line 6, and implement the equation:
(ADDR(r.symbol) + r.addend - refaddr); 

where r.addend = -4, refaddr = ADDR(s) + r.offset, and r.offset = 0xa
ADDR(s) = ADDR(.test) and ADDR(r.symbol) = ADDR(swap)
A. 
r.symbol + (-4) - ADDR(s) - offset = 
	0x4004f8 - 4 - 0x4004e0 - 0xa
	= 4004f4 - 4004e0 - a 
	= 0xa or 10 in decimal

B.
r.symbol + addend - ADDR(s) - offset = 
	0x400500 - 4 - 0x4004d0 - a
	= 0x4004FC - 4004da
	= 0x22 or 34 in decimal
